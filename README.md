Here is my repository for my Spring Intro to Data Science projects. 
The April 11th file is my first successful attempt at pushing files from my local directory to this remote repository.
You will find folders to organize other files, most importantly the Final Project and Project 2. 
This repository in itself is true to the lessons that I have learned over the course of this semester. 
I am excited to expand on this knowledge moving forward in my exploration of data science to aid my digital humanities research.
Thank you!
